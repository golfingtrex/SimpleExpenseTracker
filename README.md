## Description
A simple expense tracker/budgeting desktop application using a modern Dashboard-style UI in WPF.

## Purpose
To expose myself to the burden of designing and implementing a desktop application with a modern look, feel and feature set in WPF.

## Movitation
I believe WPF development to be a foundational skill for the modern programmer. It is foundational because of its ubiquitousness and support and the skills learned in developing WPF applications make the learning curve shallower when learning new GUI technologies such as Xamarin, .NET MAUI or GDK.

## Goals
To learn the basics of creating a dashboard in WPF, primarily focusing on the XAML side of things. To increase my value as a developer and provide a gateway to other GUI technologies.
